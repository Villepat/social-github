    -> Group creator will have to get notified that someone requested access to the group
        -> Group creator will have to accept or deny the request
            -> If accepted, the user will be added to the group
            -> If denied, the user will not be added to the group
-Group creator can invite users to the group
        -> the users will get notified that they have been invited to the group
